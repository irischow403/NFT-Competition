# NFT-Competition

Digital assets has become very popular over the years. NFT has been used to do auction in arts, music and sports. NFT is relatively new when compare to other cryptographic digital assets. There is a lot more to explore in terms of the stability and price potential in NFT. Therefore, our analy- sis aims to select variables to predict final price of NFT. Moreover, we visualised different variables to observe the relationship with final selling price.

We used Shiny in R to build an interactive dashboard webpage and used Python to fit machine learning models to predict the final prices of digital products based on vari- ables including auction type, last sale final price, favorites, duration.
